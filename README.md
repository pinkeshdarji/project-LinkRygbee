# project-LinkRygbee
This project enables users to create accounts (and login) using their LinkedIn profile.Once the profile is created all sectional information (eg: Summary, industry, location , Experience, etc.) is pulled up in a nice dashboard (and stored in OrientDB). Whatever gets stored in OrientDB is synced into Elasticsearch.There is a search mechanism in the frontend to look up for registered people having similar interests.
